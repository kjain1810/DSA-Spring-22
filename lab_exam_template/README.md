# Lab Exam Templates

The following code will be provided to the students to use in the lab exams.

## Files
1. bin\_tree.c : Implementation of binary tree ADT
2. copy\_lines.sh : Bash script to copy particular lines from one file to another
3. deque.c : Implementation of a double ended queue ADT
4. linked-list.c : Implementation of a linked list ADT
5. hash-table.c : Implementation of a hash table ADT without the hashing function

### Copy lines
Usage:
```bash
sh ./copy_lines.sh <source_file> <start_line> <end_line> <target_file> <target_line>
```

This command copies lines number between `start_line` and `end_line` in `source_file` to `target_file` starting from line number `target_line`.

Might be useful during the exam :)
